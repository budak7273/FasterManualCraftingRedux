Update 1.0 support. Removed the loss of speed when you stop crafting but keep the same recipe selected. This update brought to you by Robb.




The hook that implemented the "lose your speed bonus when idling in the bench" feature broke, and I can't find a good fix for it, so let's just call its removal a 'feature' now. This means you keep your speed bonus when crafting something the ingredients are slowly trickling in for (ex. Dimensional Depot). Note that you still lose your speed bonus if you switch recipes or exit the bench.
